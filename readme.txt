Thanks for your interesting in our work.

These files include both of the results and a simple implementation of our ECCV14 paper for color constancy in Matlab. 
Everybody can directly utilize the results on four datasets without running again the algorithms of our ECCV14 paper.  

This code can only be used for academic research. 

If you use these materials in your research work, please cite our paper:
